    <h2>Welcome to the Natto CMS!</h2>
    
    <p class="warning">Make sure to change the bootstrapped user's password immediately!</p>
    
    <p>This is the bootstrapped home page.  Please <a href="/login">sign in</a> with the bootstrapped user to edit it.</p>
    
    <p>You should also set the email for this account.  Site contacts go to the admin user's email, by default.</p>
    
    <h3>Default admin user's credentials</h3>
    
    <dl><dt>Login</dt><dd>admin</dd><dt>Password</dt><dd>admin</dd></dl>
    
    <h2>Navigating the Administration Pages</h2>
    
    <p>Press <code>shift + spacebar</code> and type a controller name!  We're still working on this functionality, but expect it to improve rapidly.  Maybe soon we will get a 'help' command in there. Of course, you must be logged in for this to work.</p>
    
    <h2>Generating Crypted Passwords and Salts</h2>
    
    <p>The bootstrapped administrator is also bootstrapped with a salt.  You should change this salt for your production environment, as it is slightly predictable (at least by me).</p>
    
    <p>One option is to just make a new user and give them the administrator role.  Delete the old admin, and problem solved.</p>
